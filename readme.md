## Shrekbot! 

Shrekbot is a discord.js bot developed by BiizoNinja#6969 on discord! Unfortunatlry it got deleted but there was the code for the bot! So I decided to make it public! Some of the code was given by [FiredragonPlayz](https://github.com/firedragonplayz), [reconlx](https://github.com/reconlx) and [Hackerboi69](https://github.com/thehackerboi69github)!
