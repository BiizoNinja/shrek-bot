## About

[Discountinued] Shrekbot used to be a verified discord bot with many features. The owner (me) then discountinued this bot in around September 2021. But, you still can use all code into your own bot without credit. Chreck the other tabs on instructions on how to build one yourself. 

## Features

- ### **User Friendly Help Command!**
  We have an amazing help command. You will not get confused while navigating commands at all!

- #### **Clean Suggestion system**
  ShrekBot has a suggestion system where the admin can set up a channel and a manager role! Your server members can suggest features for your server and you the owner can approve or deny them to your liking!
