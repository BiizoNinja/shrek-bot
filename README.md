## Contributing

Feel free to create a pull request! And if you want your code/command to be added make sure to **fork** the repository! Also give a ‚≠ê if you like it ;)
Using the entire project/parts of the code is completely fine. But giving credit is appreciated >:)

Although the code is completely free to use and without credit, I would realy like for you to give credit in some form as this takes me a lot of time to make. To see some plagiarizer to add it to their bot and say they made it, it drives me mad. It really demotivates me to make more open source projects.
