## Contributing

Feel free to create a pull request! If you want a command or feature to be added you can create an [issue](https://github.com/BiizoNinja/shrek-bot/issues/new), or you can fork it and add it yourself! Also give a ‚≠ê if you like it ;)
Using the entire project/parts of the code is completely fine, but giving credit is appreciated >:)

Although the code is completely free to use and without credit, I would realy like for you to give credit in some form as this takes me a lot of time to make. To see some plagiarizer to add it to their bot and say they made it, it drives me mad. It really demotivates me to make more open source projects.
