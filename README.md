## About 
ShrekBot used to be a **verified** discord bot! But the idiot owner (me) decided to delete for some reason??? So I've been thinking to bring it back and I don't what better way other than this!
The new ShrekBot is designed to be **made by the community!** so forks are always welcome! I'll be checking forks frequently and updating the bot frequently! Also make sure to post working code! You can invite the [public version](https://dsc.gg/shrekbot) to see all the features of the bot without compiling yourself.

## Features 
- Community Made
- Open Source
- All categories you can ever think of!

(more when the community gets involved)

## Building

Instructions can be found in [BUILDING.md](https://github.com/BiizoNinja/shrek-bot/blob/master/BUILDING.md)

## Contributing
Feel free to create a pull request! And if you want your code/command to be added make sure to **fork** the repository! Also give a ⭐ if you like it ;) 
Using the entire project/parts of the code is completely fine. But giving credit is appreciated >:)
